- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dreadlee
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Programming and Coding and furthering all knowledge in those departments. Beginner and green as they come.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... I am taking the CS50 course, learning C and Python at the moment, or well.. trying too.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... any beginner or learn based projects would be amazing but I am not getting to invested due to the fact I am only learning at this time.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
